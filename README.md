# Buildless Static Site

An example of vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (plus a [Lit](https://lit.dev) example) with zero build tooling, yet using a "modern" web development workflow courtesy of custom elements, CSS module scripts, and import maps.

To view this website locally, all you need is [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/).

First, install dependencies:

```shell
$ npm i
```

Then, run the web server:

```shell
$ npm run dev
```

Bear in mind that the Node web server has nothing to do with the functioning of the website, it's strictly for demoing purposes. You could use a web server written in Ruby, Go, Rust, use Nginx or Apache, whatever. The static site files in the `public` folder require zero build tooling and can served from anywhere.
